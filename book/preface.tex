This manual is intended as an introduction to the use of the Basys3 FPGA when
programmed with a WRAMP processor.
This includes programming for WRAMP and using the physical capabilities of the boards.
It covers the basics of the WRAMP assembly language, the WRAMP tools, and the I/O
devices implemented on the Basys boards.

Although every effort has been made to make this manual accurate, it is
possible that there may be errors in it. If you find any, please report
them to the author.

This manual is an update to the one detailing the WRAMP architecture as
implemented on the original REX boards used by the University of Waikato.
It was mainly the product of a lot of hard work by Matt Jervis
and Jamie Curtis. Other people that contributed to its content
were Murray Pearson, Tony McGregor, and Dean Armstrong.
The update was written by Daniel Oosterwijk and Tyler Marriner in
tandem with their development of the Basys implementation of WRAMP.

This version was last updated on \today.
