o Does you code require that the letters are typed in any order (eg one 
  character on the Linux machine, one on the terminal, one on the Linux 
  machine ...). How do you avoid that ?

o Explain the use of the status register.

o What would you need to change to alter the program so it uppercases
  characters input on the Linux machine and flips the case of all the
  characters input on the Terminal (eg swap both of the ports) ?

o Show the code related to getting the character from the Linux machine

o Why do we have to check the status register before sending and receiving a 
  character ?

o Show the code related to changing the case of all characters read
  from the Linux machine.
