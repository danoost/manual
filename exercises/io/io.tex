\section{Assessment}

To show that you have completed this exercise to a satisfactory
standard you will be required to demonstrate at a verification session
that the program you wrote in \textbf{Question~\ref{ques:final}} of this exercise
runs correctly. In addition the marker may ask one or two questions so
they establish that you understand what you have done.  These
verification sessions will be held in \ASSESSROOM during the following two
times: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \IODUE~\MORNINGASSESS
\item \IODUE~\AFTERNOONASSESS
\end{itemize}

In an attempt to ensure that the verification process runs smoothly
six machines in \ASSESSROOM will be booked for this purpose during the two
sessions. When it is your turn to have your program verified you
should log onto one of these machines and get your program ready to
run on the REX board. A marker will then verify your program. Once
your program has been verified you should log off immediately to allow
the next person to prepare to have their program verified.

In addition to the verification process there will be a closed book
exercise test on~\textbf{\IOTEST}. The test can cover any material
from exercises 4 or 5.

\section{Objective}

The purpose of this exercise is to reinforce the ideas presented in
lectures on I/O devices. To achieve this goal you will be asked to
write WRAMP code to correctly talk to the I/O devices provided on the
REX board.

\section{Introduction}
There are a range of I/O systems provided on the REX Board. This
exercise will deal with two particular devices:

\begin{itemize}
\item A parallel port
\item A dual serial port
\end{itemize}

In order to complete this exercise, you will need to read Chapter 3 of the REX \& WRAMP Manual.

\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a program which continually (i.e. is in an infinite loop)
reads the values on the switches and outputs the value read to the two
seven segment displays. This is the same question as question 10 of
exercise 3, however this time you should \textbf{not} use the writessd
and readswitches routines that you were provided with for that
exercise. You should instead directly talk to the parallel port using
the addresses supplied in chapter 3 of your manual.

\item 
\label{ques:single}

Write a program that sends an X to the serial port that is
connected to the terminal above the board. Do not use any library
routines to do the I/O (e.g. putstr). Instead manipulate the serial
port directly.

\item 
\label{ques:badmult}
Modify the program you wrote in question~\ref{ques:single} to output
25 Xs' without first checking the status register to make sure that
the serial device is ready to send the next character. When you run
the program what happens?  Why? \textit{Note:} single stepping through
your program will cause very different effects to running your program
without any breaks in execution. Why?

\item Modify the program you wrote in question~\ref{ques:badmult} so
that all of the Xs' are sent correctly out through the serial port.

\item 
\label{ques:upperlower}
Write a program that continually reads characters from the serial port
connected to the terminal, converts any \textbf{lowercase} characters
to \textbf{uppercase} and outputs them to the serial port connected to
the Linux machine. (e.g. if an 'a' is received on the serial port
connected to the terminal then an 'A' will be output to the serial
port connected to the Linux machine. However, if an 'A' is received on
the serial port connected to the terminal then an 'A' is output to the
serial port connected to the Linux machine.)

\item 
\label{ques:switchcase}
Modify the program you wrote in question~\ref{ques:upperlower} so that
it reads the characters from the Linux machine and outputs to the
terminal. Also modify the program so that instead of making all
characters uppercase it changes the case of all characters
input. (i.e. you should make all lowercase characters uppercase and
all uppercase characters lower case.) You should be careful not to
modify any non-character that is input such as spaces or punctuation.

\item 
\label{ques:final}
Write a program that combines the functionality of both programs
in~\ref{ques:upperlower} and~\ref{ques:switchcase}
simultaneously. That is the program should both output
\textbf{uppercase} versions of the characters typed on the terminal to
the Linux machine and switch the case of all characters input on the
Linux machine and display that to the terminal. To achieve this your
program will to contain a loop that repeatedly polls each of the
devices (i.e. the terminal and the Linux machine) in turn to see if a
character has been received, and if so outputs it to the appropriate
serial interface.
