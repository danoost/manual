1. Which instructions set up the stack frame ?

2. Which instructions tear down the stack frame ?

3. Show me the code that gets your argument passed to you by main.

4. Show me the code that puts the arguments on the stack for 
   counter().

5. How much do you grow and shrink the stack by ?

6. Which location in the stack do you save the RA in ?

7. Which registers do you save upon entry ?

8. Which registers do you restore upon exit ?

You should look over the save and restore code for all people and make sure 
that you believe that they are correctly saving and restoring all the registers
they use.

If it appears that they are not, ask them why, and tell them that they must 
save *all* registers besides $1 that they use. If they don't fix it they only
get an "Attempted"
