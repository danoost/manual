make :

(nb it is assumed that this is in the folder ~/comp201!  If not then
modifiy the variable BASEPATH in the Makefile)

eps        - make all eps graphics
dvi        - make guide dvi files (build/xxx.dvi)
standalone - make guide ps/pdf files (output/guide/xxx.ps/.pdf)

all        - make all of the above

clean      - remove everything including intermediate files
cleanout   - remove .dvi and .ps/.pdf only.  allows dvi file to be built twice
             for latex to update references.
